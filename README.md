# Instacart Market Basket Analysis

This Jupyter notebook aims to perform a market basket analysis using the Apriori algorithm and association rule mining on the [Instacart dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/instacart-market-basket-analysis). This dataset contains detailed transaction data from a large number of orders made by various customers over a period.

## Project Description

Market Basket Analysis is a modelling technique based upon the theory that if you buy a certain group of items, you are more (or less) likely to buy another group of items. For example, if you are shopping on Amazon and you buy a new laptop, you might also be prompted to buy laptop accessories like a mouse, laptop bag, or external keyboard, as these items are frequently bought together.

The aim of this project is to identify relationships or associations between specific items, in this case, the 450 most frequent products out of 49677 products. This is a classic problem statement in the realm of data science and machine learning, with a multitude of applications in recommendation systems, website browsing behavior, medical diagnosis, and more.

## Prerequisites

The project uses Python as the primary language and requires you to have a basic understanding of Python programming. Additionally, familiarity with pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and MLxtend is recommended.

## Tools Used

- `Python`
- `Pandas`
- `Numpy`
- `Matplotlib`
- `MLxtend`

## Installation

You can install the necessary libraries by running the following command:

```python
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib mlxtend
```

## Running the Notebook

To run the notebook, you need to have Jupyter installed in your environment. Once you have that, you can start the notebook by typing `jupyter notebook` in the terminal or command prompt.
